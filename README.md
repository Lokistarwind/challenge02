 # Challenge 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

The project is to build a webpage that displays a portfolio of my work and contact information. It is designed to be both a way to familiarize myself with CSS and a means to create a document to be used when sending applications.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage


You can use this code to look out a layout of what you can use to make a portfolio for job seeking and to understand fundemental concepts in css styling when building a page.

## Credits
For this challenge assignment, I used some code snippets from the class activities for the css class of row, column and card. I also used the universal class box sizing function. The classes used were used as a foundation to structure and build upon the webpage.

The portfolio image is concept art owned by capcom that I reworked and use as an avatar
